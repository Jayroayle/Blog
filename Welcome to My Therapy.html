I experience chronic pain every moment of every day which, I imagine will have some affect on my writing and design choices. And I'm okay with that. Because really, this site is about my growth and expression. (say something about the emotional challenge)</p1>

<p class="paragraph">5.27.16: My Therapy will begin as a basic HTML and CSS enterprise (if that means anything to you) but, as I learn more about coding, the site will become more decorative, responsive and interactive.

 I didn't want to create just another basic, pre-packaged blog. You know the type. You click to add your favorite theme or color, drag a box here, drop a picture there. I wanted a blog that was also going to challenge me technically. I wanted this to be a space for true artistry, and not just through.</p2>
